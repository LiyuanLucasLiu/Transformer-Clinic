<h2 align="center">Admin</h2>
<h5 align="center">Understanding the Difficulty of Training Transformers</h5>

Guided by our analyses, we propose **Ad**aptive **M**odel **In**itialization (Admin), which successfully stabilizes previously-diverged Transformer training and achieves better performance, **without introducing additional hyper-parameters**. The design of Admin is half-precision friendly and can be **reparameterized into the original Transformer**. 

In our experiments, Admin [easily stabilize the training of 200L Transformer](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/Transformer-Clinic/blob/master/nmt-experiments/wmt14_en-de.md). We didn't try deeper Transformer, as [our study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07772.pdf) shows that balancing depth, width, and encoder-decoder split is better than na√Øve stacking more layers. Still, we believe Admin can handle the training of Transformer, up to 1000+ layers, if necessary. 

We are in an early-release beta. Expect some adventures and rough edges.

## Introduction
<h5 align="center"><i>What complicates Transformer training?</i></h5>

In our study, we go beyond gradient vanishing and identify an __amplification effect__ that substantially influences Transformer training. 
Specifically, for each layer in a multi-layer Transformer, heavy dependency on its residual branch makes training unstable, yet light dependency leads to sub-optimal performance.

## Dependency and Amplification Effect

Our analysis starts from the observation that Pre-LN is more robust than Post-LN, whereas Post-LN typically leads to a better performance. 
As shown in Figure 1, we find these two variants have different layer dependency patterns.

With further exploration, we find that for a N-layer residual network, after updating its parameters W to W\*, its outputs change is proportion to the dependency on residual branches. 

<p align="center"><img width="60%" src="img/output_change.png"/></p>

Intuitively, since a larger output change indicates a more unsmooth loss surface, the large dependency complicates training.
Moreover, we propose Admin (**ad**aptive **m**odel **in**itialization), which starts the training from the area with a smoother surface. 
More details can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08249).

## Quick Start Guide

Our implementation is based on the fairseq package (`python 3.6, torch 1.5/1.6` are recommended). It can be installed by:
```
git clone https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/Transforemr-Clinic.git
cd fairseq
pip install --editable .
```
The guidance for reproducing our results is available at:
- [WMT'14 De-En](nmt-experiments/wmt14_en-de.md)
- [WMT'14 De-Fr](nmt-experiments/wmt14_en-fr.md)
- [IWSLT'14 En-De](nmt-experiments/iwslt14_de-en.md)

Specifically, our implementation requires to first set ```--init-type adaptive-profiling``` and use one GPU for this profiling stage, then set ```--init-type adaptive``` and start training.
